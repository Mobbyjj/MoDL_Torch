# MoDL_Torch
This is a self-implemented torch version for MoDL. For further information and original implementation, please refer to: 

https://github.com/hkaggarwal/modl

I also separate the CGSENSE procedure in the CGSENSE.py

Different from the original code, I utilize first 50 slices in the test dataset for validation. Hope it doesn't bother. -- please check util.py

I tried to mimic the tensorflow version using the torch for brain dataset, **but its performance deteriorated**. If you figure out, please feel free to contact me.
